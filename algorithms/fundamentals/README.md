# Fundamental Algorithms
Algorithms treated under this section are classified as "fundamental" based on the level of implementation 
difficulty. 
### Linear Search
Linear search also termed as a sequential search is a relatively simple search algorithm that traverses through a collection/data structure.  
It steps through each space in the structure and compares the elements there with the desired search target.  
**Big OH: Log(N)**  

### Binary Search
