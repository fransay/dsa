# Fundamental Algorithms
Algorithms treated under this section are classified as "fundamental" based on the level of implementation 
difficulty. Please note, this label is entirely subjective and must not be treated as a generic convention.
### Linear Search
Linear search also termed as a sequential search is a relatively simple search algorithm that traverses through a collection/data structure.  
It steps through each space in the structure and compares the elements there with the desired search target.  
**Big OH: O(N)**  

### Binary Search
Don't think much, reduce the search space of the array by half at each time
a search comparison is made,that is all, you've made yourself the binary search algorithm.  
The binary search algorithm is an efficient search yet simple to implement.  
**Big OH: Log(N)**
