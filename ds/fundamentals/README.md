# Fundamental Data Structures
Data structures under this section are classified fundamental,kindly take note this label as it is entirely
subjective and must not be treated as a generic convention.
## Preamble
`Data dominates. If you have chosen the right data structures and organised things well, the algorithm will always be 
self evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.`- Rob Pike. This quote stands tall and true in 
all aspect of computer programming, organisation of data in their right structures makes good software. 
### Traditional Structures
These are highly optimised in built structures in programming languages, e.g. a List in Python, Maps in Go, etc.
Below are an unordered list of some in built data structures in the python programming language.
* **List**
* **Dictionary**
* **Set**

### Linked Link
* **Singly Linked List**
* **Doubly Linked List**
* **Circular LinkedList**
